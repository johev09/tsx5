Website developed to promote fest organized by university club.

> This is one of my early works when I was just learning to develop websites using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. May have used some libraries by accident ðŸ˜…. You will also find the website filled with [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) HTML element and CSS animations (which I recently discovered during that time) that made the website slow to run on low-spec machines. Fun times ðŸ˜†.
